NMAI to Mukurtu Workflow
========================

NMAI delivery
_____________

The NMAI delivers metadata and media requests by email. That email typically includes:

- A link to a Dropbox folder containing:

  - The original or preservation files for all materials. Most commonly TIFF files.
  - PDF files for documents and manuscripts.
  
- An XML document with the catalog record metadata. 
- An XLSX document with additional notes note found in the catalog. This file may also include some or all of the catalog record metadata.

We recommend saving the contents of the Dropbox file and the attached documents locally as soon as possible. We are unsure how long the NMAI retains the Dropbox folders for access.

Processing media files
______________________

We recommend generating access copies of all media files for use in Mukurtu.
